If you are looking for a way to scare your guests and neighbors this Halloween, you might want to try AtmosFX digital decorations. AtmosFX is a company that produces high-quality video projections that can transform any surface into a realistic and immersive scene. One of their most popular products is the Zombie Invasion DVD, which features dozens of hungry zombies breaking through windows, doors, walls, and even your TV screen.
 
The Zombie Invasion DVD is compatible with any projector, TV, or monitor. You can use it indoors or outdoors, on windows, walls, ceilings, or props. You can also customize the effects by choosing from different display modes, such as horizontal or vertical, and different backgrounds, such as brick wall or wood paneling. You can even mix and match different zombies to create your own horde.

To use the Zombie Invasion DVD, you will need a DVD player or a computer with a DVD drive, a projector or a TV/monitor, and some speakers. You will also need some materials to create a projection surface, such as a white sheet, a window cling, or a 3DFX form. A 3DFX form is an inflatable mannequin-like prop that comes to life when paired with AtmosFX 3DFX decorations. It is perfect for creating realistic and three-dimensional zombies that seem to pop out of the screen.
 
Here are the steps to create a zombie invasion with AtmosFX digital decorations:
 
1. Choose a location for your display. It can be a window, a wall, a door, a TV screen, or a 3DFX form. Make sure the area is dark enough for the projection to be visible.
2. Set up your projector or TV/monitor and connect it to your DVD player or computer. Adjust the brightness, contrast, and focus of your projector or TV/monitor to get the best image quality.
3. Insert the Zombie Invasion DVD into your DVD player or computer and select the display mode and background that suit your location. You can also select the individual zombies you want to display.
4. Create a projection surface for your display. If you are using a window, you can use a white sheet or a window cling to cover it. If you are using a wall or a door, you can use a white sheet or a cardboard cutout to create a hole. If you are using a TV screen, you can just turn it on. If you are using a 3DFX form, you can inflate it and place it in front of your projector or TV/monitor.
5. Turn on your speakers and adjust the volume to create a realistic sound effect.
6. Enjoy the show and watch your guests and neighbors scream in terror as they witness a zombie invasion!
